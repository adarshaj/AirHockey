## Todo : 

V# Support Resize! and/or fullscreen
## Increase mouse sensitivity in MainMenu? 
## Custom music
## Chat? 
## Change the poller (eventManager) to 'bite off' more than 20 events at once
V# Investigate memory leaks in ftgl code
## Add entry and exit functions in each gamestate that are called on each gamestate switch 
## Make display lists out of mainmenu pictures, and the bats, and the puck

## Anti-aliasing : 
## 	Investigate GL_MULTISAMPLE_ARB, , needs to create window with that pixel format? 
## 	Try w/ bigger objects, and bigger clipping volume, in the same window
##	Fall back to accum buffer smoothing

V# Make player and bats and puck inits callable from game_mainmenu on transition to game_running
V# i.e., Add single-use-only pattern to all loadModels( ) functions

## Add NetworkProgramming threads
## Add error checking while initialising each module, so that the game can still be played w/o 
## certain modules, (example : networking, anti-aliasing)

## *** Can't run more than 1 instance of AirHockey at once!!! 
V#     Fixed the Networking part (try to bind to another socket)
V#     Some issue w/ peepEvents : peepEvents fails when another udp server is running on the same socket_number
## Looks fine now. Soln. : try to bind to 2000, and if failed, try to bind to 6000

## Move applicable stuff into globalDefs.h
## Change class member definitions from public to private where applicable

## Support themes in settings
## Make more themes

V# Add textboxs for input and for credits etc
V# Add controls in game_settings.h ? or keep it in game_mainmenu.h ? [edit : looks like it'll stay in game_mainmenu.h, for now]
V# Have added some basic UI elements (FontPrinter, Panel, TextInput)
V# Have the sub-buttons pop up in the middle of the screen w/ a CPanel around them
V# Let CTextInput remain a CPanelObjek
V# Add highlight/popout support for clabel
V# Add pointLiesWithin/click supprot for cpanel
## TextInput is numeric and periods only for now (ip address)
V# Add inputDoneHandler to TextInput
## !! Panel.enable/disableChildren doesn't work
V# Add "enter remote server's ip address" label
V# Add backspace support to TextInput
## Add appropriate errorHandling to checkIpAddr( ) 
## Make sure that clicking on multiplayer_panel does not make it vanish; basically, add clickHandler for Panel and set it empty here

## Physics

## AI for when playing singleplayer mode

## Check if mouse/bat binding is good enough on any system; think about it

## Add throttle to networking delay so as not to inundate a slow network with too many packets
